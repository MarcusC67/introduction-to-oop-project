# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
A set of activities to give an overview of the concepts of modelling &amp; Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Software Engineering.

By the end of this activity, you will be able to demonstrate a basic understanding of the following skill areas:


- Draw a simple class diagram in the Unified Modelling Language (UML) to model a class
- Translate a class diagram to create a simple class in code
- Create a class model to demonstrate inheritance by creating subclasses extending on a base class
- Understand what an Abstract class means and be able to create an abstract class
- Understand what method overriding is and be able to apply it to define different implementations for a method
- Demonstrate basic usage of the four principles of OOP (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance)
- Understand the Diamond of Death i.e. the problems with multiple inheritance
- Understand that classes can implement multiple interfaces
- Create an Interface and implement it in a class
